# SHLO-Knapsack-Test
Short Test Code of the SHLO algorithm knapsack problem

This code is based on the paper: "A Simple Human Learning Optimization Algorithm" (SHLO). 

They have made public some example code of this at https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/65577-human-learning-optimization-hlo-algorithm

I incorporated the described variables for run replications, num items, max weight, etc. 

The data collection code then wrote the results to the csv file. The last 2 columns allow for making sure that your data set is the same as the one in the code.
To verify, make your dataset and sum all the weights/profits and verify that they are the same as in the csv
